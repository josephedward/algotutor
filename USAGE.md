# AlgoTutor - Quick Start Guide

## Current Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Core Features Implemented:**
- Real-time Python code execution with test cases
- Algorithm pattern recognition
- Progressive hint system
- Socratic questioning framework
- Session persistence with JSON storage
- Line-by-line feedback analysis
- User progress tracking

## Quick Demo

Run the demonstration to see all features in action:

```bash
python demo.py
```

This will show:
- Two different solution approaches to the Two Sum problem
- Real-time code execution and testing
- Algorithm pattern recognition
- Socratic questioning
- Progressive feedback system

## Interactive Usage

For the full interactive experience:

```bash
python simple_tutor.py
```

Enter your username when prompted, then:
1. Choose "Solve a problem"
2. Select from available problems (Two Sum, Valid Parentheses)
3. Use the interactive features:
   - Write/edit your solution
   - Get progressive hints
   - Submit for testing and feedback

## Key Features Demonstrated

1. **Real-time Code Execution**: Execute Python code safely with timeout protection
2. **Intelligent Testing**: Automated test case execution with detailed results
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Automatically detect algorithm patterns in code
4. **Socratic Questioning**: Guide learning through thoughtful questions
5. **Progressive Hints**: 3-level hint system that doesn't give away answers
6. **Persistence**: Save user progress and attempt history
7. **Feedback Analysis**: Detailed analysis of solution quality and complexity

## Architecture Highlights

- **Modular Design**: Separate services for execution, feedback, and storage
- **Safe Execution**: Sandboxed Python code execution with AST parsing
- **Pattern Detection**: Heuristic-based algorithm pattern recognition
- **Data Persistence**: JSON-based storage for user data and session history
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy to add new problems, patterns, and feedback types

## Next Steps for Full LLM Integration

To enable full AI-powered features:

1. Add OpenAI API key to `.env` file
2. Install additional dependencies: `pip install openai python-dotenv`
3. The full `algotutor/` module structure supports advanced LLM features:
   - Dynamic problem generation
   - Sophisticated line-by-line analysis
   - Adaptive curriculum progression
   - Advanced Socratic dialogue

## Problem Categories Available

- **Arrays & Strings**: Two Sum, string manipulation
- **Stack/Queue**: Valid Parentheses, bracket matching
- **Extensible**: Easy to add more problem types and difficulty levels

The implementation demonstrates all the core concepts from the problem statement while providing a working foundation for the full LLM-powered system.
