# Study System Analysis for Algorithm Tutor

## Overview
This document analyzes the requirements and design considerations for implementing an effective study system within a Python algorithm tutor application.

## Study System Components

### 1. Learning Path Management
- **Adaptive Progression**: System should adapt difficulty based on student performance
- **Prerequisites**: Track completion of prerequisite concepts before advancing
- **Personalized Pacing**: Allow students to progress at their own optimal speed
- **Topic Dependencies**: Map relationships between algorithmic concepts

### 2. Progress Tracking
- **Performance Metrics**: Track accuracy, time to completion, attempts per problem
- **Learning Analytics**: Identify patterns in student learning and common mistakes
- **Milestone Tracking**: Monitor completion of major algorithmic concepts
- **Session History**: Maintain detailed logs of study sessions

### 3. Assessment Framework
- **Formative Assessment**: Continuous evaluation during learning
- **Summative Assessment**: Periodic comprehensive evaluations
- **Self-Assessment**: Tools for students to evaluate their own understanding
- **Peer Assessment**: Optional collaborative learning features

### 4. Content Organization
- **Skill Taxonomy**: Hierarchical organization of algorithmic concepts
- **Difficulty Grading**: Consistent difficulty rating system
- **Topic Clustering**: Group related algorithms and data structures
- **Resource Mapping**: Link concepts to appropriate learning materials

### 5. Feedback Mechanisms
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time response to student inputs
